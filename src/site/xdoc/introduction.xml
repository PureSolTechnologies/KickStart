				The Java Virtual Machine is a great environment to run
				applications in, but the distribution of the applications in JAR
				files which need to be coupled together is a nightmare. This
				nightmare got the name JAR Hell. Every application to be started
				consisting of more than one JAR file is difficult to distribute,
				because the JAR files need to be opened and altered to get the
				MANIFEST.MF files' CLASSPATH entry right.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some technologies were developed due to the JAR hell like Java EE
				containers, OSGi and so forth which tackle the issue on different
				levels in different complexities. But, for a simple Java command
				line tool or a small Swing application it is still to complex.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this niche KickStart provides the functionality needed to start
				Java applications without the need to package all JARs into a large,
				fat JAR and without ana additional heavy-weight container.
				Kickstart's executable JAR is used and a properties files containing
				some information and that's it. A simple, light-weight Java
				application can be deployed in a cross-platform manner.
